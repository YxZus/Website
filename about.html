            <p>A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, 
            like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole 
            heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, 
            which was...</p>
            <p><strong>Created for the bliss</strong> of souls like mine. 
            I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite 
            sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents. 
            I should be in.</p>

        <p>A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, 
        like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole 
        heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, 
        which was created for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so 
        happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of 
        mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents.</p>
        <p>I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the 
        present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist 
        than now.</p>
        <p>When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, 
        and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the 
        impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams 
        steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the 
        tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the 
        earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear 
        the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar 
        with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies, 
        then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his 
        own image, and the breath of that universal love which bears and 
        sustains us, as it floats around us in an eternity of bliss; and 
        then, my friend, when darkness overspreads my eyes, and heaven 
        and earth seem to dwell in my soul and absorb its power, like 
        the form of a beloved mistress, then I often think with longing, 
        Oh, would I could describe these conceptions, could impress upon 
        paper all that is living so full and warm within me, that it 
        might be the mirror of my soul, as my soul is the mirror of the 
        infinite God!</p>
        <p>O my friend -- but it is too much for my strength -- I sink 
        under the weight of the splendour of these visions! A wonderful 
        serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet 
        mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, 
        and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created 
        for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, 
        so absorbed in the exquisite sense</p>
